# Notebooks

This directory should contain all notebooks used in the project. 

If you are using only a single notebook, you can place input/output directories in this folder. If you are using multiple notebooks, split it into multiple subdirectories that can run independently and link the Makefile at [shared/Makefile](/shared/Makefile)
